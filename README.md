# BibliOWL Ontology

### Álvaro González Berdasco y Lucía Martín Fernández

The BibliOWL ontology has been created to connect information about the physical Libraries and the content of its catalogues.

The general goal of the BibliOWL ontology is to model data about libraries regarding its location, organization, provided services and administration, together with its users and the description of its catalogue. The catalogue is composed of different items corresponding to various resources related to different creative works expressions. The ontology includes information about the characteristics of these contents. The class loan relates users with items so that the library's content movement can be tracked.
